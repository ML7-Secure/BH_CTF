We create an account with register

We login

We target the settings/change_password function

By inspecting the source, we see that there is a parameter 'session' that is a fixed value (== base64 encoding of the user) that is sent when modifying password (WE VERIFY THIS WITH BURP)

The IDOR vulnerability is the following :

- Request change password (put any password) with the user account BUT put the base64 encoding of 'admin' (==YWRtaW4) in the session parameter with BURP ==> IDOR triggered, we just changed the password of the admin user (full takeover)

- Log in with admin:admin => flag in /settings
